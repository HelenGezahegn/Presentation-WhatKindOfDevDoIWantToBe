# Presentation: Help! How do I know What Kind of Dev do I Want to be?

This is a collection of the issues, links and materials I will use to complete a workshop about the different types of developers that students are choosing from.

## Description:
Front-end developer? Back-end developer? Data engineer? Security? DevOps? Full-stack? Auto? QA?

Join me to help you get an idea of what kind of developer you want to pursue! We will take 10 minutes for each sub-section of developing and work through a real-life bug and fix it and then you will have a better idea of what developing is in each of these jobs.

## Tools:
- I will be using [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) to do live coding for the front end and security bugs.
